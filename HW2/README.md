# Machine Learning Homework: Classification Methods Analysis

## Project Overview
This homework explores advanced classification techniques through theoretical and practical approaches using the `pd_speech.arff` dataset, focusing on k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Naïve Bayes classifiers.

## Theoretical Tasks
The theoretical component involves:
- Computing recall for a distance-weighted k-NN classifier
- Learning a Bayesian classifier with specific probabilistic assumptions
- Calculating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) probabilities
- Exploring decision threshold optimization

## Programming Implementation
The programming tasks require:
- Performing 10-fold stratified cross-validation
- Implementing k-NN (k=5, uniform weights, Euclidean distance)
- Implementing Naïve Bayes (Gaussian assumption)
- Generating cumulative testing confusion matrices
- Conducting statistical hypothesis testing to compare classifier performance

## Key Technical Components
- Classification Algorithms: 
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Naïve Bayes
- Validation Technique: 10-fold Stratified Cross-Validation
- Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing of classifier performance
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, SciPy

## Objectives
